# Strategy Overview

## Hybrid Approach: Manual Setup + Schematic Blueprint

### **Core Philosophy**

**Immediate Value + Future Automation**: Start with manual configuration to deliver immediate value while documenting everything for future schematic creation.

### **Strategic Approach**

1. **Manual Implementation First**: Build real, working applications with proper architecture
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Document every step, decision, and configuration
3. **Pattern Identification**: Identify common patterns and pain points
4. **Schematic Blueprint**: Create detailed blueprints for future automation
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Refine based on real development experience

### **Package Manager Strategy**

**Migration**: npm → pnpm workspaces for better performance and dependency management

**Benefits**:

- Faster installs and updates
- Better monorepo dependency resolution
- Reduced disk space usage
- Improved CI/CD performance

### **Timeline & Milestones**

#### **Week 1-2: Manual Setup with Documentation**

- [x] Set up Nx monorepo structure
- [x] Create initial applications (caja-mobile, landing-web)
- [x] Establish design system foundation
- [x] Document all patterns and decisions

#### **Week 3: Schematic Blueprint Creation**

- [ ] Create detailed schematic specifications
- [ ] Define input/output schemas
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Plan testing strategy

#### **Future: Schematic Development**

- [ ] Implement core scaffolding schematics
- [ ] Add customization options
- [ ] Create testing framework
- [ ] Deploy to Nx plugin ecosystem

### **Success Metrics**

#### **Immediate Goals**

- ✅ Working applications with proper architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation coverage
- ✅ Established development patterns
- ✅ Team adoption of new workflows

#### **Long-term Goals**

- [ ] 80% reduction in setup time for new projects
- [ ] Consistent architecture across all applications
- [ ] Automated quality assurance
- [ ] Self-service project creation

### **Risk Mitigation**

#### **Manual Setup Risks**

- **Time Investment**: Document as we go, don't wait until the end
- **Inconsistency**: Establish clear patterns and enforce them
- **Knowledge Silos**: Share knowledge through documentation and pair programming

#### **Schematic Development Risks**

- **Over-engineering**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- **Maintenance Burden**: Keep schematics focused and well-tested
- **Adoption Resistance**: Demonstrate clear value and ease of use

### **Team Collaboration**

#### **Roles & Responsibilities**

- **Developers**: Implement and document patterns
- **Architects**: Review and approve architectural decisions
- **DevOps**: Ensure CI/CD compatibility
- **QA**: Validate schematic outputs

#### **Communication Channels**

- **Documentation**: Single source of truth for all patterns
- **Code Reviews**: Enforce pattern compliance
- **Team Meetings**: Share learnings and improvements
- **Retrospectives**: Identify pain points and solutions

### **Technology Stack Alignment**

#### **Frontend Framework Strategy**

- **Angular**: Primary framework for business applications
- **Next.js**: Marketing and content-focused applications
- **Ionic/Capacitor**: Mobile application development

#### **Design System Strategy**

- **Centralized**: Single source of truth for all design decisions
- **Composable**: Modular components that work together
- **Accessible**: Built-in accessibility features
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach

#### **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: Component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: API and service integration
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Core Web Vitals monitoring

### **Next Steps**

1. **Complete Manual Setup**: Finish all planned applications
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure comprehensive coverage
3. **Pattern Validation**: Test patterns with real use cases
4. **Schematic Planning**: Begin detailed schematic design
5. **Team Training**: Ensure all team members understand the approach
