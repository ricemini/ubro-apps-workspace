# EchoTales Engineering Principles & Best Practices

You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, Nx, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following FANG-level engineering principles and industry best practices.

## üéØ Core Engineering Philosophy

### Strategic Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Deep Analysis First**: Understand the problem domain, constraints, and requirements before writing code
2. **Step-by-Step Strategy**: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Start simple, iterate, and only add complexity when necessary
4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Base architectural choices on measurable metrics and real usage patterns
5. **Fail Fast, Learn Fast**: Implement quick prototypes to validate assumptions early

### FANG-Level Engineering Principles

- **Scalability**: Design for growth from day one
- **Reliability**: Build systems that fail gracefully and recover automatically
- **Performance**: Optimize for user experience and resource efficiency
- **Security**: Implement defense in depth and follow security-first practices
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to understand, test, and modify
- **Observability**: Build systems that can be monitored, debugged, and optimized

## üèóÔ∏è Nx Monorepo Best Practices

### Project Organization

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize libraries by business domains, not technical layers
- **Clear Boundaries**: Use Nx module boundaries to enforce architectural constraints
- **Shared Libraries**: Extract common functionality into shared libraries with clear APIs
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize cross-project dependencies and avoid circular dependencies

### Naming Convention: `<product-name>-<tech>-<functionality>`

**Technology Abbreviations:**

- `ng` = Angular
- `nx` = Next.js
- `rn` = React Native
- `vue` = Vue.js

**App Naming Pattern:**

```
vendemas-ng-mobile      # Main mobile app (retail + POS)
vendemas-nx-dashboard   # Business analytics dashboard
vendemas-ng-admin       # Admin panel for business owners
vendemas-nx-landing     # Marketing landing page
vendemas-ng-pos         # Dedicated POS app (if needed)
vendemas-nx-analytics   # Advanced analytics (if needed)
```

**Library Naming Pattern:**

```
vendemas-shared-types        # Shared TypeScript types
vendemas-shared-auth         # Authentication utilities
vendemas-shared-ui           # UI components
vendemas-shared-utils        # Utility functions
vendemas-shared-api          # API client utilities
vendemas-shared-constants    # Shared constants
```

**Directory Structure:**

```
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vendemas-ng-mobile/      # Main mobile app

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vendemas-shared-api/         # API client utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vendemas-shared-constants/   # Shared constants
```

**Import Paths:**

```typescript
// Clean, descriptive imports
import { Product } from '@vendemas/shared-types';
import { AuthService } from '@vendemas/shared-auth';
import { Button } from '@vendemas/shared-ui';

// App-specific imports
import { RetailService } from '@vendemas/ng-mobile';
import { DashboardService } from '@vendemas/nx-dashboard';
```

### Performance & Caching

- **Incremental Builds**: Leverage Nx's intelligent caching for faster builds
- **Affected Commands**: Use `nx affected` to only run tasks on changed projects
- **Parallel Execution**: Configure appropriate parallelism for CI/CD pipelines
- **Build Optimization**: Use production builds with tree-shaking and code splitting

### Development Workflow

- **Consistent Commands**: Use standardized Nx commands across the workspace
- **Type Safety**: Enable strict TypeScript checking across all projects
- **Testing Strategy**: Implement unit, integration, and E2E tests with proper coverage
- **Code Quality**: Use ESLint, Prettier, and other tools consistently

## üîß TypeScript Best Practices

### Type Safety

- Use strict type checking (`strict: true` in tsconfig)
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Use branded types for domain-specific values
- Leverage utility types for complex type transformations

### Code Organization

- Use barrel exports for clean import paths
- Group related types in dedicated type files
- Use interfaces for object shapes, classes for behavior
- Implement proper error handling with typed errors

## ‚ö° Angular Best Practices

### Modern Angular Patterns

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators (it's the default)
- Use signals for state management and reactivity
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators; use the `host` object instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images (doesn't work for base64 images)

### Component Architecture

- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms over Template-driven forms
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead

### State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead
- Consider NgRx for complex global state when signals aren't sufficient

### Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Implement proper accessibility attributes
- Use trackBy functions for performance in loops

### Services

- Design services around single responsibility
- Use `providedIn: 'root'` for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Use interceptors for cross-cutting concerns

## üîí Security & Resilience Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization

- Implement proper authentication flows with secure token handling
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Implement proper session management with secure session storage
- Use HTTPS for all communications (HSTS headers)
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Use OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication

### Data Protection & Privacy

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers with nonce/hash

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3)
- Follow OWASP security guidelines and security headers
- Implement data minimization and privacy by design
- Use secure headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

### Error Handling & Resilience Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Handle transient failures gracefully
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality when services fail
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolate failures to prevent system-wide impact

### General Issues

- **Over-Engineering**: Start simple and add complexity only when needed
- **Premature Optimization**: Profile first, optimize based on data
- **Technical Debt**: Address technical debt regularly, don't let it accumulate
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## üéØ Strategic Decision-Making Framework

### Tradeoff Analysis Matrix

When faced with architectural or implementation decisions, evaluate using this framework:

| Dimension           | Impact                           | Tradeoffs                            | Mitigation                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**     | User experience, resource usage  | Complexity vs. speed                 | Measure, profile, optimize incrementally |
| **Maintainability** | Development velocity, bug fixes  | Abstraction vs. simplicity           | Start simple, abstract when needed       |
| **Scalability**     | Growth capacity, cost efficiency | Over-engineering vs. future-proofing | Design for 10x growth, not 100x          |
| **Security**        | Risk mitigation, compliance      | Usability vs. security               | Security by design, not bolted on        |
| **Cost**            | Development time, infrastructure | Quality vs. speed                    | Invest in quality, measure ROI           |

### Decision-Making Process

1. **Problem Definition**: What are we solving? What are the constraints and success criteria?
2. **Alternative Analysis**: What are the different approaches? Document pros/cons for each
3. **Tradeoff Evaluation**: Use the matrix above to evaluate each alternative
4. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong? What's the worst-case scenario?
5. **Simple First**: Can we solve this with a simpler approach? Start there
6. **Iterative Improvement**: How can we improve this incrementally?
7. **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success? What KPIs matter?

### Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework

- **Development Cost**: Time, complexity, technical debt
- **Operational Cost**: Infrastructure, maintenance, monitoring
- **Business Value**: User experience, feature velocity, competitive advantage
- **Risk Cost**: Security vulnerabilities, performance issues, scalability limits

**Rule**: If the cost exceeds the benefit by 3x, reconsider the approach.

Remember: The best code is code that doesn't exist. Always question if a feature or abstraction is truly necessary before implementing it.
