# Testing & Code Quality Best Practices

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components and services
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Test system performance under load

### Testing Best Practices

- Write tests that are fast, reliable, and maintainable
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths

## 🔍 Code Quality, Maintainability & Team Collaboration

### Code Organization

- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case)
- Use meaningful variable and function names (descriptive, not abbreviated)
- Keep functions small and focused (< 20 lines, single responsibility)
- Implement proper error handling with typed errors
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent
- Use dependency injection for testability and flexibility

### Documentation

- Write clear, concise comments for complex logic (why, not what)
- Maintain up-to-date README files with setup and usage instructions
- Document API contracts and interfaces with examples
- Use JSDoc for public APIs with parameter descriptions
- Keep documentation close to code (inline comments, README files)
- Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for major decisions

### Code Review & Collaboration

- **Pull Request Guidelines**: Clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI changes
- **Review Checklist**: Security, performance, testing, documentation, accessibility
- **Review Process**: At least 2 approvals, address all comments before merge
- **Pair Programming**: For complex features, debugging, and knowledge sharing
- **Code Standards**: Automated linting, formatting, and type checking
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Tech talks, documentation, and mentoring

### Refactoring & Technical Debt

- Refactor code regularly to improve maintainability (20% time allocation)
- Remove dead code and unused dependencies (automated detection)
- Simplify complex logic (extract methods, reduce nesting)
- Extract reusable components and utilities (DRY principle)
- Maintain consistent code style (automated formatting)
- Track technical debt and prioritize improvements

### Scalability Patterns

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services, load balancing, database sharding
- **Vertical Scaling**: Resource optimization, caching, connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching (CDN, application, database)
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization, read replicas
- **Microservices**: Service boundaries, API design, inter-service communication
