# Security & Performance Best Practices

## ðŸ”’ Security & Resilience Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization

- Implement proper authentication flows with secure token handling
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Implement proper session management with secure session storage
- Use HTTPS for all communications (HSTS headers)
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Use OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication

### Data Protection & Privacy

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers with nonce/hash
- Implement proper CORS policies (specific origins, not \*)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3)
- Follow OWASP security guidelines and security headers
- Implement data minimization and privacy by design
- Use secure headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

### Error Handling & Resilience Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Handle transient failures gracefully
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality when services fail
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolate failures to prevent system-wide impact
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle failed message processing
- **Health Checks**: Monitor service health and fail fast
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage

### Security Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Security Logging**: Log security events and access attempts
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitor for suspicious activities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security assessments
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for security incidents
- **Security Metrics**: Track security KPIs and trends

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization & Measurement

### Performance Targets & KPIs

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB initial, < 2MB total
- **Build Time**: < 30s for incremental builds
- **Test Execution**: < 60s for full test suite

### Frontend Performance

- Implement lazy loading for routes and components
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists (>1000 items)
- Optimize bundle size with tree-shaking and code splitting
- Implement proper caching strategies (HTTP, service worker, memory)
- Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks (>50ms)
- Optimize images and assets (WebP, responsive images)
- Implement critical CSS inlining
- Use preloading for critical resources

### Backend Performance

- Implement proper database indexing (query analysis first)
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement caching layers (Redis, CDN, application cache)
- Use pagination for large datasets (>100 items)
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use database query optimization (EXPLAIN, query analysis)
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Use async processing for non-critical operations

### Performance Measurement Strategy

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Core Web Vitals, custom metrics
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI, performance budgets
- **Error Tracking**: Error rates, performance degradation alerts
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Business Metrics**: Conversion rates, user engagement

### Performance Optimization Process

1. **Measure First**: Establish baseline metrics
2. **Profile**: Identify bottlenecks (Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse)
3. **Optimize**: Apply targeted improvements
4. **Validate**: Measure impact of changes
5. **Monitor**: Track performance over time
