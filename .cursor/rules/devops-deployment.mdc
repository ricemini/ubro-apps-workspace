# DevOps, Deployment & Observability

## ðŸš€ Deployment, DevOps & Observability

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Implement automated testing in CI/CD (unit, integration, E2E)
- Use semantic versioning for releases (Conventional Commits)
- Implement proper environment management (dev, staging, prod)
- Use feature flags for safe deployments and A/B testing
- Monitor application health and performance in real-time
- Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Use automated rollback mechanisms for failed deployments

### Environment Management

- Use environment-specific configurations (12-factor app principles)
- Implement proper secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform/CloudFormation
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery strategies
- Monitor and alert on system health with SLOs/SLIs
- Use containerization for consistent deployments (Docker)

### Observability & Monitoring

- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and log levels
- **Metrics**: Application metrics, business metrics, infrastructure metrics
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows across services
- **Alerting**: Intelligent alerting with proper thresholds and escalation
- **Dashboards**: Real-time dashboards for system health and business metrics
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error tracking with stack traces and context

### SLOs & SLIs (Service Level Objectives/Indicators)

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- **Latency**: P95 < 200ms, P99 < 500ms
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate
- **Throughput**: Handle expected peak load with 50% headroom
- **Recovery Time**: < 5 minutes for automated recovery

### Data-Driven Decision Making

- **A/B Testing**: Test hypotheses with statistical significance
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollouts and experimentation
- **User Analytics**: Track user behavior and feature adoption
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor Core Web Vitals and business metrics
- **Cost Optimization**: Track infrastructure costs and optimize usage
