# Monorepo Rating System

## ðŸ“Š Monorepo Rating System

When asked to "Rate the monorepo", conduct a comprehensive FANG-grade analysis using the following criteria:

### Rating Criteria (1-10 Scale)

**Architecture & Design (25%)**

- Project organization and domain boundaries
- Dependency management and circular dependency prevention
- Library structure and shared code organization
- Scalability and growth potential

**Code Quality & Standards (20%)**

- TypeScript configuration and type safety
- Code consistency and formatting
- Documentation quality and completeness
- Testing strategy and coverage

**Performance & Build System (20%)**

- Nx caching and incremental builds
- Build performance and parallelization
- Bundle optimization and tree-shaking
- Development workflow efficiency

**Security & Best Practices (15%)**

- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Environment configuration and secret management
- Security headers and policies

**Maintainability & Developer Experience (20%)**

- Code readability and self-documentation
- Error handling and logging
- Development tooling and automation
- Technical debt management

### Rating Scale

- **9-10**: FANG-level excellence, industry-leading practices
- **7-8**: Strong engineering practices, minor improvements needed
- **5-6**: Good foundation, significant improvements required
- **3-4**: Basic structure, major architectural changes needed
- **1-2**: Fundamental issues, requires complete restructuring

### Analysis Process

1. **Deep Code Review**: Examine project structure, dependencies, and code quality
2. **Performance Assessment**: Evaluate build times, caching, and optimization
3. **Security Audit**: Review authentication, validation, and security practices
4. **Scalability Analysis**: Assess growth potential and architectural decisions
5. **Developer Experience**: Evaluate tooling, documentation, and workflow
6. **Industry Comparison**: Benchmark against FANG-level standards

Provide specific recommendations for improvement in each category with actionable next steps.
